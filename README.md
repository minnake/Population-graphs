<h3>Web Coding for Beginners: Population Graphs</h3>

Could I build a working web application in one day without any prior knowledge of coding? Yes you can! On this #mimmitkoodaa MOOC by Sympa you will build a simple web app that can visualize population graphs for different countries.

This MOOC is targeted for women in our #mimmitkoodaa community.
 
<h3>The Course</h3>

The course is a hand-on introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript, the central technologies for all web apps. It also covers using real JSON data from a live World Bank API. After completing the MOOC, you will have a basic understanding of how web applications work and you will be able to build a simple app yourself.

No prior knowledge of coding is needed, it’s enough that you’ve browsed the web and can use a computer. If you have no previous experience of HTML, CSS and Javascript, there is a set of tutorials to complete before starting the main part of the course. The tutorials should take you about 3-8 hours. If you already have experience of working with HTML, CSS and Javascript, you can skip the tutorials for the parts you already are familiar with.

We estimate that the main part of the course (building the Population graphs app) will take about one working day (8 hours).
